# The Penal Colony
## Collected Stories - Everyman's Library Edition 1993

Eichmann, Eichmann, Eichmann! A person so abosrbed in his work and his professional pride that he totally loses touch with the reality of the moral implications of what he is doing! And his idle complaints against the new Commandant versus his idolization of the previous. The plans for the machine are his most precious posession. The bit about the strap vs the chain and how he wants the machine to be as perfect as possible. The fact that the harrow is glass so that he can fully observe the proceedings and that he has captured and studied the proceedings of the multi-hour executions down to minute details. The industrialization/mechanization of execution which separates the executor from the deed a couple of degrees. Reminiscient of death camps.

The soldier guarding the condemned was caught doing the very thing that the condemned was sentanced for!

Guilty and given no chance to argue innocence! Get that exact quote!

The harrowing machine! This is the thing from Hyperion! Needles and spines and tree of pain and all!

The explorer is such a huge trope! he even has a quote where he thinks about intervening out of moral obligation, which basically never happens in books that use this trope! you took a picture of the passage, quote it!
