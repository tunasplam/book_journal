# Book Journal

I am reviving my old book journal but making it more succinct and structured.
Organize entries by author (directory) and title (file).

Here is the format:

# Title
## Edition information (so that page numbers can be referenced)

## Summary

## Reaction

## Notable Quotes/Passages

## Connections
